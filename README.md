# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 3

## Investigate-a-Dataset

### Project Overview
In this project, we will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. we will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make our analysis easier.

**What do we need to install?**

We will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv

#### Why this Project?
In this project, We'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

We'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

#### What will we learn?
After completing the project, we will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format we can use.
- Have experience communicating the results of our analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up our data analysis code.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let us access our data more conveniently.
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing our findings.
